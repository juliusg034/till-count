<p id="description">One of my responsibilities as a food service manager is money handling. Each night that till must be set to a standard amount such as $300.00 and the rest is to be deposited. It is common practice to deposit the largest bills and keep the smaller bills to have enough bills to give out change to customers.<br><br>While not an overly complicated process it does take an average of 15-25 minutes to get all the money situated and to do the math. At first, I made a simple Python script to do all the math for me and changed it to a 5-10-minute task with no fear of doing the math wrong or depositing the wrong bills. To share this with my coworkers I decided to make a website version of the simple Python script.</p>
